# This YAML file shows how to deploy the snapshot controller

# The snapshot controller implements the control loop for CSI snapshot functionality.
# It should be installed as part of the base Kubernetes distribution in an appropriate
# namespace for components implementing base system functionality. For installing with
# Vanilla Kubernetes, kube-system makes sense for the namespace.
