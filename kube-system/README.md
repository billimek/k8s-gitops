# descheduler

Leveraging [descheduler](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/descheduler) to automatically evict pods that no longer satisfy their NodeAffinity constraints.  This is used to work in concert with `node-feature-discovery` such that when USB devices are moved from one node to a different node, the pods requiring the USB devices will be properly forced to reschedule to the new location

# reloader

[reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader): A Kubernetes controller to watch changes in ConfigMap and Secrets and do rolling upgrades on Pods with their associated Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet and DeploymentConfig

* [reloader/](reloader/reloader.yaml)

# snapshot-controller

[snapshot-controller](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter): Sidecar container that watches Kubernetes Snapshot CRD objects and triggers CreateSnapshot/DeleteSnapshot against a CSI endpoint.  Used in conjunction with volsync.
